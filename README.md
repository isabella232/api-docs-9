# API Documentation

View the documentation at [api.vapor.codes](http://api.vapor.codes).

This repo contains the script that generates all vapor api-docs when a new release is cut.
For every repo, on release a github action calls into a script that pulls in the latest version of this repo to the server, then running the provided script.
